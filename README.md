Room Acoustic Analyzer | Best Measures for Acoustic
An acoustic analyzer and a best measures finder
Written by Victor M. Leao ("milodraco")

There's a bunch of acoustic analyzers out there, but I wanted to write a code that works a little different. It analyzes and calculates some parameters and
gives you a grade between 0 and [theoricaly] 100.
The other code goes a little further: it helps you to determine the best measures BEFORE building a acoustic room. You insert the maximum measures and the
algorithm calculates all the possibilities.

They work only with cuboid ("rectangular") rooms, I have no idea how to calculate other shapes. The calculations have to be revised, there are some numbers
slightly wrongs.

It's pretty WIP. Constributions are welcome.
